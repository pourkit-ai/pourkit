# pourkit

AI-driven issue-to-PR workflow for GitHub repositories.

## Workspace

- `pourkit`: CLI and agent orchestration (`@pourkit/cli`)
- `common/logger`: structured logging (`@pourkit/logger`)

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies with `npm install`
2. Run the CLI with `pourkit`
3. Run tests with `npm test` (human) or `npm run test:agent` (agent/CI)
4. Run typecheck with `npm run typecheck`
5. Run build with `npm run build`

## GitHub Authentication

Pourkit uses environment variable tokens for GitHub API access. Token precedence:

1. `POURKIT_GITHUB_TOKEN` — Pourkit-specific token (highest priority)
2. `GH_TOKEN` — GitHub token
3. `GITHUB_TOKEN` — GitHub Actions default token

Fine-grained personal access tokens (PATs) are preferred. Classic PATs and GitHub Actions `GITHUB_TOKEN` (with sufficient repository permissions) are also supported.

Set the desired token in your environment before running Pourkit. No separate GitHub command-line authentication is required for Pourkit runtime.

## Branch And Release Flow

Pourkit uses `dev` as the protected integration branch and two protected release lanes:

- **`dev`** — Integration branch. One-off work targets `dev`, and completed `PRD-00N` branches merge back to `dev`.

- **`next`** — Development Releases. Promoting `dev -> next` runs full verification, package smoke checks, and publishes a unique Changesets snapshot to npm under the `next` dist-tag. No GitHub release or permanent git tag is created.

- **`main`** — Stable Releases. Every push to `main` runs full verification, package smoke checks, and uses Changesets to open or update a Version Packages PR. Merging that PR publishes `@pourkit/cli@latest` with durable release metadata.

### Changeset requirement

User-facing one-off PRs into `dev` include a Changeset file (`.changeset/*.md`). Child issue PRs into `PRD-00N` skip Changesets by default; the final `PRD-00N -> dev` PR carries one summarized Changeset when user-facing.

PRs targeting `next` or `main` must include a Changeset or the `no-changeset-needed` label. Internal changes such as refactors, CI, docs, tests, and build work skip Changesets by default.

Run `npx changeset` in your working directory to create a Changeset.

> Do not run `npm run changeset:publish` or `npx changeset publish` from a developer machine. Publishing is handled automatically by CI workflows on the `next` and `main` branches.

See `.pourkit/docs/agents/git-workflow.md` for the full branch, PR, hotfix, and promotion policy.

## Pourkit CLI

### Issue Workflow

- `pourkit issue <number> --target <name> --config <path>` is the canonical entry point for the single-issue workflow.

### Queue Workflow

- `pourkit queue-run` processes runnable Issues from the target Queue sequentially.

### Serena Commands

- `pourkit serena init --target <name>` initializes the Serena sidecar baseline, data directory, and first index for a target base branch.
- `pourkit serena start` / `pourkit serena stop` manage the Serena sidecar container lifecycle.
- `pourkit serena status --target <name>` reports sidecar health and baseline staleness.
- `pourkit serena refresh --target <name>` updates the Serena Baseline Worktree to the target `baseBranch` HEAD.
- `POURKIT_SERENA_MCP_URL` and `POURKIT_SERENA_SANDBOX_MCP_URL` override configured Serena MCP URLs at runtime.

### PR Workflow
- `pourkit pr create --config <path> --target <name> --title <title>` is the canonical PR creation workflow for humans and agents.
- `pourkit pr merge <number>` is the canonical PR merge workflow. It waits for checks, merges through Pourkit's Octokit-backed provider, and waits for the target branch to become green.
- `npm run pourkit:e2e` exercises the live end-to-end coverage for that workflow.
